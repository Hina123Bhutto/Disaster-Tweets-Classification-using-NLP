# Disaster-Tweets-Classification-using-NLP
Disaster tweets classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a text classification task that involves the use of NLP techniques and machine learning models to determine whether a given tweet or text message is related to a disaster or emergency event.
Data Collection:

The first step is to gather a labeled dataset of tweets. This dataset should contain tweets that are clearly categorized as related to disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, wildfires) and tweets that are not related to disasters (normal tweets).
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the text data to make it suitable for analysis. This typically includes tasks like removing punctuation, stop words, and special characters, as well as stemming or lemmatization.
Feature Extraction:

Convert the text data into numerical features that can be used as input for machine learning models. Common methods for feature extraction in NLP include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.
Model Selection:

Choose a machine learning or deep learning model for text classification. Common models include:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Transformer-based models like BERT or GPT
Training the Model:

Train the selected model on the labeled training dataset. The model learns to recognize patterns and associations in the text data that distinguish disaster-related tweets from non-disaster tweets.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess how well it classifies tweets.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance. This can involve fine-tuning parameters like learning rate, batch size, and model architecture.
Testing and Validation:

Test the trained model on a separate, labeled test dataset to assess its generalization and real-world performance.
Deployment:

If the model meets the desired performance criteria, it can be deployed for real-time classification of tweets. This can be done via APIs, web applications, or other means.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it as needed to adapt to changing data and trends.
